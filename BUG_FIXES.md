# Bug Fixes - Portfolio Updates

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. Theme Color Not Changing on Slider Movement (FIXED)
**Problem:** When moving the slider to 55%, the theme was applying automatically even though you were just previewing.

**Solution:**
- Modified `updateLightness()` function to ONLY update the preview box
- Changed default load behavior to NOT auto-apply custom lightness
- Theme now only changes when you click the "Apply" button
- Slider at 55% is just the default position, doesn't trigger theme change
- First-time users get standard dark-blue theme
- Only users who previously saved a custom lightness get it auto-applied

**Result:** Moving the slider now just shows a preview. You must click "Apply" to actually change the theme.

### 2. Game Controller Title Still Cropping (FIXED)
**Problem:** "Design of a Game Controller" title was still being cut off in the card.

**Solutions Applied:**
- Increased card minimum width from `300px` to `320px`
- Reduced font size from `1.4rem` to `1.3rem` for better fit
- Improved line height from `1.3` to `1.4` for better readability
- Added `hyphens: auto` for better word breaking if needed
- Kept word wrapping and overflow wrapping enabled

**Result:** Title now displays fully without cropping, even on smaller screens.

### 3. Unity Logo Color Not Staying Dark (FIXED)
**Problem:** Unity logo was changing color with the theme (was purple #667eea).

**Solution:**
- Changed Unity icon color to dark `#222222` (almost black)
- Added `!important` flag to prevent theme system from overriding it
- Applied to both index.html and personal-projects.html
- Unity logo now maintains its professional dark appearance

**Result:** Unity logo stays dark regardless of theme selection, matching Unity's brand identity.

### 4. Personal Projects Page Theme Consistency (ENSURED)
**Problem:** Need to ensure personal-projects.html uses the same theme as index.html.

**Solution:**
- Added CSS variable initialization to personal-projects.html
- Included theme_switcher.js on the page
- Same CSS files loaded (style.css, nav.css, footer.css)
- Theme system applies to both pages consistently

**Result:** Personal projects page matches the main portfolio theme perfectly.

- Never affected by theme changes
- Matches Unity's professional branding

### Game Controller Card
